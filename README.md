Tools Used : Jupyter Notebook
Programming Language: Python
Libraries used: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Logistic Regression library

Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset was collected from the UCI machine learning repository and a machine learning model was built that can classify the cancer cells to Benign and Malignant. The data was trained using Logistic Regression and the modelâ€™s performance was tested on the test data.
